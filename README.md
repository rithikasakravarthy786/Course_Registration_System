📚 Course Registration System

This project is a full-stack Course Registration System developed as part of my learning journey in backend and full-stack development. The application allows users to view available courses, register for courses, and manage enrollments through a simple web interface connected to a Spring Boot backend.

🧩 What this project does

The backend is built using Spring Boot and provides REST APIs for handling course data and user enrollments.
The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which interacts with these APIs to display data dynamically and handle user actions.

This project helped me understand how frontend and backend systems work together in a real-world application.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Backend

Java

Spring Boot

Spring Data JPA

REST APIs

MySQL

Frontend

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

✨ Key Features

Display available courses

Course registration and enrollment flow

REST API-based communication between frontend and backend

Clean layered backend architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)

Data persistence using MySQL


🔗 How the frontend and backend work together

The frontend uses JavaScript to call backend REST APIs.
These APIs return data in JSON format, which is then processed and displayed on the UI.
This helped me gain hands-on experience in API integration and data flow between layers.

📚 What I learned from this project

How to design and implement RESTful APIs
